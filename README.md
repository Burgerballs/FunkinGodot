# FunkinGodot

[Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin) modding framework made
in the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org) to be a useful tool in making
whatever kind of mod you want, with more performance and easily accessible features
thanks to Godot itself.

## State of this branch (the rewrite)

Currently in the state of finishing out more minor options and things but nothing is
super stable yet. A release is still in the works (even if slowly).

See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for the credits of different people and/or groups.
